# Math Blocks: Design

The goal of Math Blocks is to provide a set of reusable libraries and components
for building interactive math applications on the web and mobile.

Math Blocks current focus is on symbolic (algebra, arithmetic, calculus, etc.).
The reason for this is that lots of students seem to struggle with these the
most and at the same time many post secondary programs use algebra as a
gate-keeper.
